  ** Description **
  
  XSLT_PEDS is a collection of scripts and XSLT formatting to facilitate
  viewing search results downloaded in XML format from the USPTO's
  Patent Examination Data System (https://ped.uspto.gov/peds/).
  

  ** Requirements & Recommendations **
  
  The following software is required or recommended for use with XSLT_PEDS:
  
    - Chromium web browser or Chrome web browser (required)
    - unzip (required)
    - zenity (recommended)
    
  Setup and use through a file manager are recommended for most users,
  but a terminal may instead be used if desired.
    
    
  ** Before Setup **
  
  If you are using the Gnome Files file manager (and perhaps other FMs),
  you may need to change a preference to enable running SETUP and other
  XSLT_PEDS files from your file manager.
  
  In Gnome Files:
    1. Click ☰
    2. Click "Preferences"
    3. Click "Behavior"
    4. Under "Executable Text Files",
       select either "Run them" or "Ask what to do", whichever you prefer.
    5. Close the "Preferences" window.
    
  Note: Nothing tragic will happen if you try to running, say, SETUP and
  the file mamager isn't able to do it. It'll just open a text editor
  showing program code.
  
  
  ** Setup **

  Unzip the XSLT_PEDS.tar.gz file into your Home folder to create an
  XSLT_PEDS folder.
  
  Open the XSLT_PEDS folder and run the file SETUP.
  
  If SETUP completes, a "SETUP Complete!" notification should pop up.
  A message box may also pop up with advice on how to resolve any issues.

  To test the setup, open the file TEST.xml. Either Chromium or Chrome
  should open and display formatted data for the patent document
  "MUSICAL INSTRUMENT SUPPORT".
  
  
  ** Usage **
  
  1. Perform a search on the USPTO's Patent Examination Data System at
  https://ped.uspto.gov/peds/.
  
  2. Request and download the resulting data in XML format.
    
  3. Move the downloaded .zip file to your XSLT_PEDS folder.
  
  4. Run the unzipping script of your choice depending on the desired
     form of the results:
     
         unzipa - Unzip All: Unzips a PEDS collection of Xml files to the
                  current folder while insuring each file has unique name.
         
         unzipf - Unzip to Folder: Unzips a PEDS collection of Xml files
                  to a folder while insuring the folder is uniquely named.
         
         unzipo - Unzip to One - Unzips a PEDS collection of Xml files
                  and combines them into one uniquely-named Xml file.
  
     The Xml file, files, or folder containing Xml files should appear in
     the XSLT_PEDS folder. Each of these files differs from a simply
     unzipped file in the addition of a link required to enable formatting
     in a properly-configured browser.
     
     Additionally, the downloaded zip file should disappear and, if not
     already there, a zipTrash folder should appear. The unzipping
     scripts move downloaded zip files into zipTrash upon completion.
     The downloded zip files are unchanged, so they can be used again if
     desired. You can retain or delete zipTrash or its contents as you
     wish.
     
  5. Open one of the generated Xml files to view the formatted PEDS data.
  
  6. Depending on the file manager used, you may be able to select
     multiple generated Xml files and hit "Enter" -- or open a context
     menu (i.e. "right-click menu") and click "Open" -- to open the files
     to view the formatted PEDS data in a collection of (randomly-ordered)
     tabs.


  ** Cavaet - Portability **
  
  To view the Xml files generated by the unzipping scripts with formatting,
  they must be in a folder containing either the peds.xsl file or a
  link to that file. Consequently, the generated Xml files can't generally
  be moved to another folder.
  
  On the other hand, a *folder* generated by unzipf *can* be moved to
  another folder and the generated Xml files it contains *can* still be
  viewed with formatting. This is because each folder is created with a
  link to peds.xsl. (For those techies out there that care... Yes, It's
  an absolute symlink so as to enable moving it anyplace on the system.)
  
  Due to the need for a properly configured browser, neither the generated
  Xml files nor folders containing them are generally portable to another
  computer while still being viewable with formatting.
